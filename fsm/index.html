		The <b>Flying Spaghetti Monster</b> (<b>FSM</b>) is the deity of the <b>Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster</b> or <b>Pastafarianism</b> (a

		<a title="Pasta" href="/fsm/pasta.html">pasta</a> and <a title="Rastafarian" href="/fsm/rastafarian.html">Rastafarian</a>) 
		is a movement that promotes a light-hearted view of religion and opposes the teaching of 
		<a title="Intelligent design" href="http://antipastebin.appspot.com/fsm/intelligent_design.html">intelligent design</a> 
		and <a title="Creationism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creationism">creationism</a> in public schools. Although adherents describe Pastafarianism

		The "Flying Spaghetti Monster" was first described in a satirical open letter written by Bobby Henderson in 2005 to protest the 
		<a title="Kansas State Board of Education" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_State_Board_of_Education">Kansas State Board of Education</a> 
		<a title="Kansas evolution hearings" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_evolution_hearings">decision</a> to permit teaching 
		<a title="Intelligent design" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design">intelligent design</a> as an alternative to evolution in public school science classes. In that
		letter, Henderson satirized <a title="Creationism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creationism">creationism</a> by professing his belief that whenever a
		scientist <a title="Radiocarbon dating" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating">carbon-dates</a> an object, a supernatural creator that closely
		resembles <a title="Spaghetti and meatballs" href="http://antipastebin.appspot.com/fsm/spaghetti_and_meatballs.html">spaghetti and meatballs</a> is there
		"changing the results with His Noodly Appendage". Henderson argued that his beliefs were just as valid as intelligent design, and called for equal time in
		science classrooms alongside intelligent design and evolution.After Henderson published the letter on his website, the Flying Spaghetti Monster rapidly became
		an Internet phenomenon and a symbol of opposition to the teaching of intelligent design in public schools.

		Pastafarian tenets (generally satires of creationism) are presented both on Henderson's <i>Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster</i> website, where he is
		described as "prophet", and in <i><a title="The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster"	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gospel_of_the_Flying_Spaghetti_Monster">The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster</a></i>, 
		written by Henderson in 2006.
		The central belief is that an invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe. <a title="Pirates" href="/fsm/Pirates">Pirates</a> are
		revered as the original Pastafarians. Henderson asserts that a decline in the number of pirates over the years is the cause of 
		<a title="Global warming" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming">global warming</a>. The FSM community congregates at Henderson's website to share 
		ideas about the Flying Spaghetti Monster and crafts representing images of it, as well as to discuss "sightings" of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
